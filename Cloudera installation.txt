Requirements:
Firstly you need to have VirtualBox installed in your system.

Step 1: To download cloudera click on any of following link.

https://www.cloudera.com 
Select quickstart vms from download tab.

OR

https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-12.html 

Go to the following website and choose platform as virtualbox, vmware, kvm or docker image as your requirement. 
I will prefer virtualbox as I’m using that one. After selecting platform login to cloudera.

Step 2: Now install cloudera

Create a new virtual machine and give a name to OS
Provide RAM, virtual hard drive space, video acceleration etc stuff in setting tab
Select Memory Size as 2GB (or half of your RAM memory) and click Next
Select a option “create a virtual hard drive now”
Select “Use an existing virtual hard drive file” and select a file with extension “.vmdk” or “.ovf” from unzipped cloudera 
And now start installing OS & provide credentials to your OS
Install vmware tool to enable sharing between the host OS and guest OS. 
Enable shared folder from “virtual machine settings” tab. Or right command for vboxsf (take reference of Google).
